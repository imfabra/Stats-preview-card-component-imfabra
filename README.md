- Mobile-first workflow
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - BEM methodology

### What I learned

With the development of this project I was able to learn to mix block contents, used to give the color of the image inside the card, the property I used was:

```css
.selector {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

Syntax:

```css
.selector {
  mix-blend-mode: normal;
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
  mix-blend-mode: screen;
  mix-blend-mode: overlay;
  mix-blend-mode: darken;
  mix-blend-mode: lighten;
  mix-blend-mode: color-dodge;
  mix-blend-mode: color-burn;
  mix-blend-mode: hard-light;
  mix-blend-mode: soft-light;
  mix-blend-mode: difference;
  mix-blend-mode: exclusion;
  mix-blend-mode: hue;
  mix-blend-mode: saturation;
  mix-blend-mode: color;
  mix-blend-mode: luminosity;
}
```
